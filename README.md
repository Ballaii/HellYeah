# Unnamed Hell Yeah Boomer Shooter

## Inspirations, Goals
- The game is inspired by Doom, Quake and the Hell Yeah Simulator (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LoXWCh63d54)
- The game will have the player go through various arenas defeating waves of enemies while their loadout will gain a new weapon, equipment each level
- Featuring mini-bosses and final bosses almost at the end of each level or wave
 
## Notice
- I have no prior experience with Unity or scripting so some features might be really buggy, been working on this since **May 5th**
- When I consider the project/game to be "complete" I will release a demo on Steam for playtesting
- Feel free to improve or recommend some features in the game
